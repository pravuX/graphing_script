## Requirements:

- matplotlib
- numpy

```sh
$ python -m pip install matplotlib, numpy
```

## Usage

```sh
$ python grapher.py
```

## Why doesn't it work??

If you're not getting the expected graph, I'd suggest wrapping the `x` variable withing paranthesis, as in `2^(x)` or `-(x)^2`. It usually does the job.
